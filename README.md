# About the GOV.UK Atom code kit
This is a code kit for [Atom](https://atom.io/) to help in the building of UK Government digital services.

## Requirements
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) by [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) by [Mozilla](https://mozilla.github.io/)

## Installation

Snippets files are stored in a package's `snippets/` folder or loaded from `~/.atom/snippets.cson`. They can be either `.json` or `.cson` file types.

To add your own snippets, select the _Atom > Snippets..._ menu option if you're using macOS, or the _File > Snippets..._ menu option if you're using Windows, or the _Edit > Snippets..._ menu option if you are using Linux.

If you are using version 6.3.0 of the GOV.UK prototyping kit, copy the elements snippets into the snippets file, otherwise, use the design system snippets.
